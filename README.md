# Project Description
This program will receive an integer value from the user. That input will be a value from 1-20. This will represent the number of indices in an array. The program will then prompt the user to enter values that are positive and divisible by 3. After the array is filled with values the program will then reverse the array in place without creating a second array.
# Goals
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of MIPS assembly ISA as well as teaching conventions associated with assembly programming such as using designated registers for data transfer, using the stack pointer to control the flow of a program for function calls within function calls, as well as input validation from the user.
